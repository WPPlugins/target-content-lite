Target content to users based on conditions that you can set. Like logged in or out, their name, role, referred from a URL, check URL parameters, days since registration, consecutive days, days since last visit. And show content if the condition isn't met. Totally personalise your visitor's and user's experience - it will engage them, convert them and make them feel a valued visitor or member of your site.

== Description ==
Use shortcodes to show content based on the condition of the user.

So far, you can show content if:

* If they are Logged In.
* If they are Logged Out.
* In they are in one (or more) WordPress roles.
* Which is brilliant for WordPress membership sites and plugins!
* And display their roles if you want to…
* If they arrived from a particular website (URL).
* Or if from a particular website with certain parameter(s) in the URL.
* That’s great for Ads and referral links.
* And Then Personalise Their Experience!
* Include their display name, first name, family name or user login.
* Or an optional guest greeting if not logged in.
* Is it their first ever visit to your site?
* Is it between a certain number of visits to site?
* For example, up to 5th, 2nd to 10th, or 20th onwards.
* Not visited for a certain number of days.
* Has visited your site on a consecutive number of days.
* For example, visited 10 days in a row.
* Been a member of your website for a certain number of days.
* For example, less than 5 days, 10-20 days, or more than 30 days.
* Has purchased a particular WooCommerce product(s).
* So you can thank them, and up-sell.
* "Hey, you bought this, you’d love this as well!"
